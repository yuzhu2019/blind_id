# Estimating Network Processes via Blind Identification of Multiple Graph Filters

These simulations were developed during 2018 and 2019 by Yu Zhu and Fernando J. Iglesias Garcia for the ICASSP 2019 paper "ESTIMATION OF NETWORK PROCESSES VIA BLIND GRAPH MULTI-FILTER IDENTIFICATION" and the 2020 Transactions on Signal Processing journal "Estimating Network Processes via Blind IdentiÔ¨Åcation of Multiple Graph Filters".
